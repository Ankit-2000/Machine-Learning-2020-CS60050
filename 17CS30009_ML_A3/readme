Output for part5.py

NMI score for 'agglomerative.txt' is 0.0245317064464		
NMI score for 'agglomerative_reduced.txt' is 0.0211924146380

NMI score for 'kmeans.txt' is 0.3459713685726

Additional remarks :

Scikit learn is not used for generation of TF-IDF matrix
 - Because in the assignment we are told to use idf (t) = log [ (1 + n) / (1 + df (t)) ].
 - Scikit learn uses  idf (t) = log [ (1 + n) / (1 + df (t)) ] + 1

For each part a test example is given to test the correctness of written algorithm.
Each test example is referred from a website, the link of which is mentioned in the respective files.
Test example can be verified by uncommenting a few lines.
